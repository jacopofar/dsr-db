# DSR: Docker and NoSQL databases

This repo contains the material for the lesson about Docker, NoSQL databases
 and data formats.

You can find the slides as PDF files in the
 ["release"](https://github.com/jacopofar/dsr-db/releases) page.

In the `docker` and `nosql_data` you can see a few examples and the code used
 to generate the slides, which are based on [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/)

## Docker

The first part of the day will cover Docker. We will see how to start
 an existing Docker image to do something useful like running a database; then
 we will see how to create our own Docker image to run our applications.

This repo contains is the code used to generate the slides, so if you are
 curious you can run `npm install && npm run dev` in the "docker" folder, but
 you need to install nodejs first.

## NoSQL

The second part of the day will be an overview of data formats and NoSQL
 databases. It is mostly a theorical topic, but there are snippets of code in
 the nosql_data folder.
